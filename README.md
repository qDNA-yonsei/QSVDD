# QSVDD

Repository for Quantum Support Vector Data Description (QSVDD): https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06375

It utilizes Pennylane: https://pennylane.ai


This repository includes code for QSVDD, Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) and Deep Support Vector Data Description (DSVDD) under similar training conditions. 

MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and credit card transaction datasets are supported.

It includes noiseless and noisy simulation that take into account of noise information observed from IBM_torino (133-qubit device).
